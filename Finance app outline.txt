Well, the finance app that we came up with basically takes a person income each month, 
calculate how much they need to spend each month for bills, life expenses, etc. Then they get to set their saving goal, 
they can estimate how much money they need for their goal and when they want to fulfill it. 
The app will take all of this information and calculate how money they are allow to use for their small interest and how much they need to save each month

AmountToSavings = PERCENT
print AmountToSavings
# This is how much the user will end up putting in savings per month to their goal
NewSavings = AmountToSavings * TIME
print NewSavings
# This is the end amount of savings WITHOUT interest
FactorInterest = NewSavings * INTEREST
print FactorInterest
WithInterest = NewSavings + FactorInterest
print WithInterest
# End amount of savings WITH interest included
# Completion = GOAL * WithInterest
print ("After " + str(TIME) + " months, you should have a savings amount of about " + str(WithInterest))
