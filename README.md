### Welcome to Tristan's Project Page!

## You will find my resume attached above, alongside whatever school or personal projects I have done recently!

I am majoring in IT at Oakland University and self teach myself on the side whenever I have the freetime. 

I am also new to programming for the most part, but do know basic syntax and use of VB, Java, and Python
